# weather-dashboard
So overall, I beleive something is inccorect with my global scope. When I have New York City
console.logged into the javascript, Dates, Humidity and Tempurature is pulled from the 
weather API. 

Once this is commented out, the entered cities aren't pulling from the APi, so there must be
 a connection issue between the search button and the call to the API.

 When a city is entered into the search field, the city is stored in local storage and
appended to an recently searched field. They are set up as buttons so a user can click them
to see the forecast again, but that is experiencing the same issue as the submit button. 

I was only able to get on icon/image to show in the Header of the forecast, but I haven't
been able to get them into the 5 day forecast cards. 

Overall I beleive I need to play with where the different functions are layed out in
 relation to one another (should my 5 day forecast be in the same function as the 
searched city field?).
